# Spotify Data Analytics

This documentation presents the findings and methodologies employed in our 3rd year KIIT minor project, focused on analyzing Spotify's hit songs to enhance the popularity of lesser-known tracks. The objective of this project was to leverage data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and insights from Spotify's popular songs and utilize them as recommendations to promote lesser-known music.This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of Spotify song data to identify trends and patterns associated with more and less popular songs. The aim of this analysis is to provide suggestions to less popular songs on how to improve their chances of success.

## Dataset

The Spotify song dataset used for this analysis is obtained from Kaggle and contains data on a sample of songs, including metrics such as the dancebility,liveliness etc. The dataset contains can be found in the repository.

You will need to download the dataset and extract the relevant CSV files to a local directory to use it for this analysis. The Jupyter Notebook contains instructions on how to read the data into Python using Pandas library.

## Analysis

The analysis is conducted using Python and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. The code for the analysis is provided in Jupyter Notebook format and can be run locally on any machine with Python and the required libraries installed.

The analysis involves identifying patterns and trends associated with more successful songs, such as genre, tempo, duration, and more. Based on these insights, suggestions are made to less popular songs on how to improve their chances of success. These suggestions may include changes to the song structure, genre, sound, or lyrics, as well as strategies for marketing and promotion.

The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations of each step in the analysis, as well as comments in the code to help readers understand what each section of code does.

### Files

- `Spotify_Data_Analytics.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of Python libraries required to run the code in the Notebook.
- `tracks.csv`:This file is used to join information from other files (such as the artists.csv and spotify_features.csv files) to get a more complete picture of each track and its attributes.
- `spotify_features.csv`:This file is used to analyze how different audio features relate to a track's popularity and to make suggestions for how less popular tracks could be improved.
- `artists.csv`:This file is used to join information with the tracks.csv file to get a more complete picture of each track's artist and their attributes

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python and the required libraries installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Once the libraries are installed, you can run the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to conduct the analysis and generate insights and suggestions for less popular songs.
